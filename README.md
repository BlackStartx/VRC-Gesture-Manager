# VRC Gesture Manager

A simple script that will help you testing you animation before uploading your avatar to VRChat.
Just download and import in your project the unitypackage that you can download here ("https://vrcmods.com/user/BlackStartx" ... WIP).

In your Asset folder you will find one named "GestureManager" and there you will find the prefab.
